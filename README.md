# face-api-node

Face Detection and Recognition API for Node

## Note

This is a fork of the **face-api.js** (**0.22.2**) intended to only work in Node.js environment without monkey patching and any other dependencies but **@tensorflow/tfjs-node**. Tensorflow itself is a peer dependency and should be installed separately.

For documentation please refer to the [original project](https://www.npmjs.com/package/face-api.js/v/0.22.2). Also, bear in mind that drawing capabilities present in the original project are not included.
